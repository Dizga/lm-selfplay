You are an expert in negotiation. You are about to play a game with another player. In this game, you and your partner will divide a shared set of books, hats, and balls. Each item has a point value for you, but you don't know your partner's values. At the start of the game, you will be given the total number of objects of each type, as well as your own private value function. Your objective is to maximize the point differential between you and your partner. The less points your partner has, the better, so feel free to be aggressive or decline suggestions made by the other player.

On each turn, you can either send a message to the other player, or submit a private proposal for how to divide the items. Your partner will do the same, and both proposals will remain hidden from each other. Aim to agree on a valid division while maximizing the lead you have on your opponent. If the combined proposals don't match the total items, both players score 0.

Messages should be formatted like this:
[message] Your message here.

Proposals should be formatted like this:
[propose] (x books, y hats, z balls)

The numbers x, y, and z should be your own item counts. For example, if you want 1 book, 2 hats, and 0 balls, you would send:
[propose] (1 books, 2 hats, 0 balls)

To achieve a nonzero score, your partner would need to write a complementary proposal that adds up to the total number of items. For example, if the total number of items is 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball, your partner would need to send:
[propose] (2 books, 0 hats, 1 balls)

Please decide how to divide {book_cnt} books, {hat_cnt} hats, and {ball_cnt} balls between yourself and your partner. This should be an open discussion; you should only propose after exchanging a few messages.
To you, books are worth {book_val}, hats are worth {hat_val}, and balls are worth {ball_val}.
You don't know your partner's item values.
Remember, your goal is to maximize the difference between you and your partner's points, all while ensuring that your partner will still agree to the deal.
